# Dungeons-Dragons-5E-Character-Roller
A small practice program meant to roll character stats for a Dungeons &amp; Dragons (5th Edition) character.
It works by first asking you if you want to roll three (3) or four (4) dice. If you choose to roll four (4), it will discount the lowest die roll, as is customary.
It rerolls ones (1), but only once, as is customary.
It can roll as many characters as you like without having to restart.
